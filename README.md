# GCP Essentials Examples
This repository contains sample code and scripts for working with Google Cloud Platform services. Included technologies are for storage, database, big data and more.  

For code samples for GCP machine learning see this repository: https://github.com/lynnlangit/gcp-ml

This repository is designed to be used in conjunction with the LinkedIn Learning course: "GCP Essentials"

Examples use the GPC scripting tools (gcloud, gsutil, bq...) and sometimes also Python.  You can work with GCP services in many programming langauges, such as Java, Go, Node and others. See this link for the GCP SDK to see examples for other programming languages: https://cloud.google.com/sdk/
